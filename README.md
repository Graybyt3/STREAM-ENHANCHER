# GRAYBYTE STREAM ENHANCER

This is a cool browser extension to make your video streaming better. It adds filters and tweaks to make videos look nice and play smooth.

## Why Use This Extension?

Sometimes videos look bad or lag a lot. GRAYBYTE STREAM ENHANCER fixes that! Here's why it's awesome:
- Makes videos clearer with filters like brightness and contrast.
- Helps videos play without buffering.
- You can change settings to make it look how you want.

## How It Works?

The extension uses some tech stuff (WebRTC and WebGL) to make videos better in real-time. Here’s the simple version:
1. It grabs the video from the website you’re watching.
2. Adds filters (like making it brighter or sharper) using cool graphics tech.
3. Makes sure the video doesn’t lag, even on slow internet.
4. Gives you a control panel to change settings easily.
